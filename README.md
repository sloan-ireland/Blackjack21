# Blackjack21
**The wonderful game of blackjack in all its glory! The house always wins :-)**

###### Group Name:
The House
###### Group members:
Sloan Ireland, Nurdaulet Kaishibayev
###### Brief Project Description:
Our project consists of a single-player card game of Blackjack. There will be a dealer/house that the player will have to play against. The dealer will randomly deal (2) shuffled cards from 4 decks to the player and himself with each competing to get the highest card number combination without going over 21. Card distribution is randomized from the remaining cards that have not been dealt. Special-type bets such as splitting and double-down are possibly going to be implemented. Furthermore, draws and natural 21s will be included. The eventual goal will be to add Insurance against the Dealer having a blackjack. Rules for blackjack will be listed in the READ ME file.
